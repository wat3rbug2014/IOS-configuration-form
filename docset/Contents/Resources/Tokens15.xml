			<Abstract type="html">This class was created to avoid confusion at the tab view controller.  The name implies
that the view controller will be used for removing devices while allowing extensibility without
harming classes that are based on the super class of FormViewController.  It overrides super
class methods for its individual use.</Abstract>
