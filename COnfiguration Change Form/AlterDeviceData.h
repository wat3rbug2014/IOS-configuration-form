/**
 * This class extends the AddDeviceData class so that it can be used in
 * the AlterDeviceViewController for adding devices.  It is a data model to
 * be used by the view controller.  The AddDeviceData class has the highest
 * data requirements, all of which could be modified.  Several of the superclasses
 * methods have been overridden to support this data model.
