/**
 * This class extends the AddDeviceController because many of the graphical
 * elements are the same or that can be used to support the idea of changing
 * a particular element of the data model.  Many of the methods from the super 
 * class have been overridden to support the ability to change elements, because
 * the requirements for information are not the same, but are optional.
